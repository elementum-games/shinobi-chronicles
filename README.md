## Contributing

Recommended workflow

1. Fork repo on GitHub (top right)

2. Clone your fork to your local machine (you can find the URL to clone under "Code")

3. Make changes to your local and test, push to your forked repo on GH
4. Open a pull request from fork => original repo
   - There's a "Contribute" button on the main page of your fork you can use to compare and open a pull request

5. After pull request is merged (and before starting work on a new feature if it's been more than a day or two) update your local fork from the original repo  
   - You can either do this via the command line, or the GitHub UI
   - For command line:
     - First, add a remote of the primary repo to your local clone
       - `git remote add upstream https://github.com/levimeahan/shinobi-chronicles.git`
     - Then when you want to update your local, run
       - `git pull upstream main`
   - For GUI
     - Click the "Fetch upstream" prompt on the GitHub page for your fork

     - Pull the changes from your GitHub fork to your local


### Local Setup

WIP rough version of one way:
- Fork repo
- Download PhpStorm (https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/)
- Open from VCS -> GitHub -> login to your account -> choose shinobi-chronicles repository from the list
- Download XAMPP (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
- Go to apache > config > httpd.conf
- Find DocumentRoot > change the path "C:\xampp\htdocs" to your shinobi-chronicles directory (you can right-click the top folder in PhpStorm after opening it > copy path > absolute path)
- change the default path below in <Directory "C:\xampp\htdocs"> to your shinobi-chronicles directory
- Go to MySQL > Admin/PhpMyAdmin > user accounts > add user "shinobi_chronicles" > give it a password (doesn't matter what it is, can just be "password") > check "create database with same name and grant all permissions"
- Go to PhpStorm, find secure/vars.sample.php and change the values to the ones from your database: user = shinobi_chronicles, database = shinobi_chronicles, password = (whatever you set)
