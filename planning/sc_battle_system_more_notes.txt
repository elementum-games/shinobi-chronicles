GENJUTSU
-Chuunin+ likely
-Clone/kawarimi at genin?
-Take effect the turn after they are cast
-Anything done to the user in the turn they are done does not cancel
-Will wear off after a certain number of turns, can be broken earlier with Genjutsu Release jutsu (Intelligence/GR jutsu level vs Intelligence / genjutsu level)
-Each turn they are active they apply an effect (damage, debuff, etc)
-Each turn they are active they become easier to break
-Lv2 genjutsu can be activated X turns after Lv1 has been active, are stronger
-True illusions? TRUE ILLUSIONS, LIE ABOUT HEALTH (prolly bad idea)
