Stats


Jutsu with health cost in battle

mangekyo style side effects

Chakra - Having more of it could be a bloodline thing

Absorbing chakra
In-combat healing(Bl stat for non-medical ninj)

Ninjutsu have two parts:
-Chakra form
-Chakra nature(element)


elements have attributes (wind = slicing)

Add these to elemental jutsu

Combination of these results in unique synergy



Chakra control stat????? 
For nin/gen

Jutsu types:

Second-tier jutsu can be learned when first-tier is level 50+


NINJUTSU

elemental weaknesses factor during collission
Fire > Wind > Lightning > Earth > Water

Jutsu collission = 25% of damage slipthrough
WInning jutsu gets remainder of damage clash added to slipthrough damage
Defensive jutsu clash with offensive jutsu down to 10% slipthrough




TAIJUTSU VS NINJUTSU
speed vs cast speed
whoever's speed is higher reduces the other's damage down to possible 25%
equal speed = both people 50% damage
damage reducd by tai skill
taijutsu vs defensive jutsu?????

TAIJUTSU VS TAIJUTSU
equal speed = both people 100% damage


GENJUTSU
-Chuunin+ likely
-Clone/kawarimi at genin?
-Take effect the turn after they are cast
-Anything done to the user in the turn they are done does not cancel
-Will wear off after a certain number of turns, can be broken earlier with Genjutsu Release jutsu (Intelligence/GR jutsu level vs Intelligence / genjutsu level)
-Each turn they are active they apply an effect (damage, debuff, etc)
-Each turn they are active they become easier to break
-Lv2 genjutsu can be activated X turns after Lv1 has been active, are stronger
-True illusions? TRUE ILLUSIONS, LIE ABOUT HEALTH (prolly bad idea)
