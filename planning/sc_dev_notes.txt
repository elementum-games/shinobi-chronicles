Shinobi Chronicles


Core is: index.php, classes.php

Resources: variables.php

-variables.php

$link // Link of main site, your page's link can be appended e.g. <a href='$link?id=7'>Travel</a>



CORE

-index.php

Handles login, top-level access control, and routing. Your pages wil be called from this script.

Once pages are finished they will be assigned a numeric id. Pages in development can be accessed through
$link?developer={your developer name}&page={your file name}

Note that code in the files needs to contain a single function named the same as the file. For instance:

http://lsmjudoka.com/projects/shinobi_chronicles/?developer=shunt_b&page=test

Would load a file named test.php and call the test() function. Similar concept to Java.



-classes.php

Contains the objects responsible for handling user data as well as system utilities.


class SystemFunctions

dbConnect()
-Establishes a database connection. Called automatically by any class methods that need db connection

clean($raw_input)
-Cleans data for insertion into the database. Must be called on any raw GET/POST form data to avoid SQL injection.

message($message, $force_message = false)
-Stores a message to be displayed later. $force_message controls whether or not to overwrite a potential existing undisplayed message.

printMessage()
-Prints the stored message, if there is any.

error($error_message)
-Logs an error message, displays a generic message to the user, and terminates script execution. Used for fatal errors such as inability to connect to database or execute a query.

query($query)
-Takes a query and runs it to the database, returning a result set if there is one and storing the number of rows returned or affected in SystemFunctions::db_num_rows or SystemFunctions::db_affected_rows respectively.
This function will check for and establish a db connection if there isn't one, but it will NOT sanitize query data. All variables from raw form input must be sanitized by clean() first.
