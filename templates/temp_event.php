            The staff at Shinobi Chronicles knows you have all been patiently waiting for an update to drop. We understand
            that you may feel like we haven't been up to much, if anything at all. We wanted to make sure everyone knew
            that we are still dedicated to our community and wanted to make you all know that we are still here
            and working on things.<br />
            <br />
            We know this event isn't a huge addition, but we thought you'd like to celebrate with us as we bring in the
            new year! Please accept these gifts while we work on getting you the combat update completed and finish completing
            some other back-end fixes.<br />
